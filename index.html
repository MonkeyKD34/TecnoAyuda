                        Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) ingeniously utilizes existing copper telephone lines to deliver broadband internet without disrupting voice services. It achieves this through Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), allocating separate frequency bands for voice, upstream data, and downstream data.

            <div class="detail-box">
                <h3>How ADSL Works</h3>
                <p>
                    The core of ADSL is Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM). A standard copper phone line can carry a wide range of frequencies, but human voice only uses a tiny fraction (0-4 kHz). ADSL technology takes advantage of this by using the higher, unused frequencies for data transmission. A device called a 'splitter' or 'microfilter' is used to separate the bands, ensuring that your phone and internet can be used simultaneously without interference. The connection is "asymmetric" because more bandwidth is allocated for downloading data to the user than for uploading data from the user, which matches typical internet usage patterns.

                    <li><strong>ADSL Modem/Router:</strong> Located at the user's premises, it communicates with the DSLAM to establish the data link over the copper line.</li>

                <h3>How FTTH Works</h3>
                <p>
                    FTTH transmits data using pulses of light through fiber optic cables, guided by a principle called Total Internal Reflection. The light travels down a central glass core by continuously bouncing off its outer layer (the cladding), allowing it to travel for kilometers with almost no signal loss. Most modern FTTH networks use a 'Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON)' architecture. This is a point-to-multipoint system where a single fiber from the provider's office is split to serve multiple households, making it an efficient way to deploy the network.

                    <li><strong>OLT (Optical Line Terminal):</strong> The provider's main equipment at the central office, which serves as the starting point for the fiber network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passive Optical Splitters:</strong> These devices are placed throughout the network to divide the light signal from one fiber into multiple paths to reach different users. They require no power, hence the term "passive."</li>
                    <li><strong>ONT (Optical Network Terminal):</strong> A device at the user's home that receives the light signal and converts it back into an electrical signal that their router and devices can use.</li>

            <h2>Deeper Technical Insights</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;">
                To better understand the evolution and operation of these technologies, the following section provides a deeper look into the key technical concepts that define them.
            </p>

            <h3>From Narrowband to Broadband: A Contextual Shift</h3>
            <p>
                The internet's journey began with narrowband technologies like dial-up, which were slow and occupied the entire phone line. The demand for an "always-on" connection with higher speeds led to the creation of broadband. <strong>ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)</strong> emerged as a brilliant transitional solution because it leveraged the vast, existing network of copper telephone wires, making it a cost-effective and rapid upgrade. However, as digital demands for streaming, gaming, and cloud services grew, the physical limitations of copper became a bottleneck. This necessitated a fundamental shift to <strong>FTTH (Fiber to the Home)</strong>, a technology built from the ground up to provide virtually limitless bandwidth and superior reliability.
            </p>

                <img src="img/Broadband.png" alt="Evolución de las tecnologías de acceso a Internet">
            </div>

            <h3>ADSL: Key Technical Details</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Discrete Multitone (DMT) Modulation:</strong> Beyond simple Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), ADSL's efficiency comes from DMT. This technique divides the data-carrying frequency bands into 255 separate sub-carriers. The system tests the signal quality of each sub-carrier and assigns more data to those with better performance. It's like having hundreds of mini-modems running in parallel, each optimizing its speed based on the specific conditions of the copper line, which maximizes the overall data rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Frequency Allocation and Limitations:</strong> The typical maximum effective distance for ADSL is between <strong>3 to 5 kilometers (about 1.8 to 3 miles)</strong>. Beyond this, signal attenuation—the degradation of the signal over distance—becomes too severe, especially for the higher frequencies that carry the most data, causing speeds to drop dramatically.

            <h3>FTTH (GPON): Key Technical Details</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>WDM and TDMA in GPON:</strong> In a GPON network, a single fiber is shared among multiple users. To manage this without data collisions, two key methods are used. <strong>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)</strong> uses different wavelengths (colors) of light to separate downstream traffic from upstream traffic (e.g., 1490 nm for downstream, 1310 nm for upstream). For the upstream path, where all users transmit on the same wavelength, <strong>Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)</strong> is used. The central OLT assigns a unique, precise time slot to each user's ONT, ensuring that their data packets travel up the shared fiber one after another in an orderly fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>"Future-Proof" by Design:</strong> The most significant strategic advantage of FTTH is its scalability. The physical fiber optic cable has a massive data capacity, far exceeding current needs. This means that as speed requirements increase in the future, the expensive deployed fiber infrastructure remains in place. Upgrades to next-generation standards like <strong>XG-PON (10 Gbps)</strong> or even faster future technologies are achieved simply by replacing the electronics (the OLT at the central office and the ONT at the user's home), making it a long-lasting and "future-proof" investment.

        <h2>Team Conclusions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In conclusion, the comparative analysis between ADSL and FTTH allows us to clearly understand how the evolution of Internet access technologies reflects both a strategic use of inherited infrastructures and a strong commitment to innovation. ADSL demonstrated the ability to adapt existing resources to meet growing demand, while fiber optics symbolizes the consolidation of a model oriented towards symmetry, speed, and reliability in data transmission. 
                Beyond the technical aspects, this reflection highlights the social impact of these technologies and the need to anticipate the challenges associated with the expansion of connectivity. For us, as future computer engineers, this exercise not only strengthens the understanding of the fundamentals of network architecture, but also emphasizes the importance of integrating a critical perspective on scalability, sustainability, and practical application.
                In this way, the task carried out is not limited to a theoretical review, but transforms into a learning experience about how the design and implementation of digital infrastructures constitute the true foundations of contemporary communication.

            <p>-Daniel Arias Rangel</p>
            <li>With this activity, I can conclude that the development of this practice allowed me to strengthen both technical knowledge and digital communication skills. By creating a web page in English that describes the operating principles of ADSL and FTTH, it was possible to analyze the differences between both technologies, their advantages, and limitations. ADSL represents a widely used solution that takes advantage of existing copper telephone lines, while FTTH offers greater bandwidth and future scalability through optical fiber.
                In addition, building the web page contributed to practicing information organization, the use of technical vocabulary in English, and the integration of content into a digital format accessible through the Internet. Likewise, I can say that the practice successfully combined theory, technology, and communication, achieving a clear understanding of broadband access methods.

            <p>-Luis Felipe Flores Sanchez</p>
            <li>The development of this web page allowed us to strengthen our understanding of the fundamental principles of ADSL and FTTH technologies. By researching and organizing the information in English, we not only improved our technical knowledge but also practiced academic writing and teamwork. We concluded that while ADSL represented an important step in broadband connectivity, FTTH offers greater advantages in terms of speed, reliability, and long-term scalability. This project also highlighted the importance of citing reliable 
                sources and presenting content clearly for future reference and learning.

            <p></p>
            <li>In developing this project, my goal was to shed light on the technological transition that defines our connection to the digital world. After in-depth research, I have come to the conclusion that the evolution from ADSL to FTTH is much more than a simple technical upgrade; it is a fundamental paradigm shift.
                Initially, I believe that ADSL was a brilliant solution that maximized the useful life of the existing copper infrastructure, building an essential bridge between the era of dial-up access and true broadband. However, it was always a solution limited by the physics of an outdated medium.
                This is where you can really see that the difference in performance is not only quantitative but also qualitative. The superiority of FTTH is not only measured in gigabits per second but in its ability to effortlessly enable our modern digital lifestyle: multiple 4K streams, uninterrupted cloud working, and low-latency online gaming—things that the physical limitations of ADSL can no longer sustain.
                More importantly, ADSL has reached its technological limit, while FTTH is a future-proof platform. The fiber optic cables installed today can support much faster speeds for decades to come, simply by upgrading the equipment at each end. I felt it was necessary to create this page to share this key point that is understanding our internet connection is essential because it is not just a convenience, but the foundation on which the innovation, education, and communication of the future will be built.
            </li>
            <p>-Oscar Moreno Perez</p>
            <li>
                In concluding this project, I understand that ADSL was a clever solution that adapted our existing telephone infrastructure to provide broadband internet. However, FTTH is clearly the future, being a technology designed from the ground up for the speed and reliability needed today. Creating this page was an excellent practical lesson that helped me understand why it's so important to invest in scalable technologies like fiber optics to ensure the communication of tomorrow.
